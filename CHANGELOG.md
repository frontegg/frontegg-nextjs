### üöÄ Major Changes
- **Store Management:**  
  Replaced the existing Redux store with Valtio. This change significantly reduces the bundle size, removes the boilerplate code associated with generator functions, and enables actions to be `async/await`. The new approach provides better stack traces and allows actions to be awaited directly, eliminating the need for callback functions.

### üîß Upgrades
- **TypeScript:**  
  Upgraded TypeScript from version `v3.9.7` to `v5.5.4`. This update ensures compatibility with the latest TypeScript features and improves overall type-checking and developer experience.

- **Testing Framework:**  
  Upgraded Jest to version `v29`. This upgrade includes performance improvements, new features, and bug fixes, ensuring more reliable and faster tests.

- **UI Dependencies:**  
  Upgraded Material UI, Emotion, and Stylis to their latest versions, enhancing UI component performance, styling flexibility, and overall user experience.

- **Node.js:**  
  Upgraded Node.js from version `16` to `18.18`, ensuring compatibility with the latest features and security updates.

### üõ† Enhancements
- **Refactor:**  
  Refactored code to use nested imports in Material UI, which helps reduce bundle size.

- **Dependencies:**  
  Incremented various dependencies, Node.js, and TypeScript to align with the latest standards and ensure better performance and security.

- **New Feature:**  
  Added a "Resend Invitation Email" action to the users table on the "All Accounts" page, improving user management capabilities.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- **Permissions & Privacy Page:**  
  Removed permissions from the privacy page. The user privacy page will now be displayed for all users in the admin portal.

### Frontegg API middleware migration
If you are using FronteggProviderNoSSR you can skip this migration:   
1. Rename imports to `@frontegg/nextjs/middleware`
2. export Next.JS config to mark as externalResolver and disable response limit.  

**API Middleware (before):**
```tsx 
export { fronteggMiddleware as default } from '@frontegg/nextjs';
```
**API Middleware (after):**
```tsx 
import { FronteggApiMiddleware } from '@frontegg/nextjs/middleware';

export default FronteggApiMiddleware;
export const config = {
  api: {
    externalResolver: true,
    // https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/api-routes-response-size-limit
    responseLimit: false,
  },
};
```
### Edge middleware migration

If you are using nextjs **edge** middleware, (Ex: `middleware.ts`):
1. Rename the imports to `@frontegg/nextjs/edge`.
2. Rename `getSession` to `getSessionOnEdge`.
3. Use `redirectToLogin` method instead of building login url.
   
    **API Middleware (before):**
    ```tsx 
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
    import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
    import { getSession, shouldByPassMiddleware } from '@frontegg/nextjs/edge';
    
    export const middleware = async (request: NextRequest) => {
      const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname;
    
      if (shouldByPassMiddleware(pathname /*, options: optional bypass configuration */)) {
        return NextResponse.next();
      }
    
      const session = await getSession(request);
      if (!session) {
        //  redirect unauthenticated user to /account/login page
        const loginUrl = `/account/login?redirectUrl=${encodeURIComponent(pathname)}`;
        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(loginUrl, process.env['FRONTEGG_APP_URL']));
      }
    return NextResponse.next();
    };
    
    export const config = {
      matcher: '/(.*)',
    };
    ```
    **API Middleware (after):**
    ```tsx
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
    import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
    import { getSessionOnEdge, shouldByPassMiddleware, redirectToLogin } from '@frontegg/nextjs/edge';
    
    export const middleware = async (request: NextRequest) => {
      const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname;
    
      if (shouldByPassMiddleware(pathname)) {
        return NextResponse.next();
      }
    
      const session = await getSessionOnEdge(request);
      if (!session) {
        return redirectToLogin(pathname);
      }
      return NextResponse.next();
    };
    
    export const config = {
      matcher: '/(.*)',
    };
    ```

### Pages architecture migration
1. Rename imports from `@frontegg/nextjs` to `@frontegg/nextjs/pages`.

    **Example (before):**
    ```tsx
    import { withFronteggApp } from '@frontegg/nextjs';
    ```
  
    **Example (after):**
    ```tsx
    import { withFronteggApp } from '@frontegg/nextjs/pages';
    ```
2. Import and then export `FronteggRouter` in your `pages/[...frontegg-router].tsx` file:

   **FronteggRouter (before):**
    ```tsx 
    export {
      FronteggRouter as default,
      FronteggRouterProps as getServerSideProps,
    } from '@frontegg/nextjs';
    ```
   **FronteggRouter (after):**
    ```tsx 
    import { FronteggRouter, FronteggRouterProps } from '@frontegg/nextjs/pages';

    export const getServerSideProps = FronteggRouterProps;
    export default FronteggRouter;
    ```

3. import getServerSideProps helpers from `@frontegg/nextjs/pages`:
    
   **Example Page (before):**
    ```tsx 
    import { GetServerSideProps } from 'next';
    import { getSession, withSSRSession } from '@frontegg/nextjs';
    
    export default function ExamplePage({ ssrSession }) {
      return  <div> My Example Page </div>;
    }
    
    export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (context) => {
      const session = await getSession(context.req);
      if (session) {
        // logged user
        return { props: { } };
      }
      // unauthorized user
      return { props: { } };
    };
    ```
    **Example Page (before):**
    ```tsx 
    import { GetServerSideProps } from 'next';
    import { getSession, withSSRSession } from '@frontegg/nextjs/pages';
    
    export default function ExamplePage({ ssrSession }) {
      return  <div> My Example Page </div>;
    }
    
    export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (context) => {
      const session = await getSession(context.req);
      
      // ...
    };
    ```
### App Directory architecture migration

1. Rename imports from `@frontegg/nextjs/server` to `@frontegg/nextjs/app`.
2. Move `FronteggAppProvider` to inside RootLayout's `<body>`:

    **RootLayout file (before):**
    ```tsx
    import { FronteggAppProvider } from '@frontegg/nextjs/server';

    export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
        const authOptions = {
          // keepSessionAlive: true // Uncomment this in order to maintain the session alive
        }
        return (
          <FronteggAppProvider authOptions={authOptions} hostedLoginBox={true}>
            <html>
              <head></head>
              <body>
                {children}
              </body>
            </html>
          </FronteggAppProvider>
        );
    }
    ```
   **RootLayout file (after):**
    ```tsx
    import { FronteggAppProvider } from '@frontegg/nextjs/app';

    export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
        const authOptions = {
          // keepSessionAlive: true // Uncomment this in order to maintain the session alive
        }
        return (
          <html>
            <head></head>
            <body>
                {/* @ts-expect-error Server Component for more details visit: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42292 */}
                <FronteggAppProvider authOptions={authOptions} hostedLoginBox={true}>
                    {children}
                </FronteggAppProvider>
            </body>
          </html>
        );
    }
    ```
3. Export FronteggAppRouter from `@frontegg/nextjs/app`, `app/[...frontegg-router]/page.tsx` file:

   **FronteggAppRouter (before):**
    ```tsx 
    export { FronteggAppRouter as default } from '@frontegg/nextjs/client';
    ```
   **FronteggAppRouter (after):**
    ```tsx 
    import { FronteggAppRouter } from '@frontegg/nextjs/app';

    export default FronteggAppRouter;
    ```

4. Rename `getSession` and `getUserTokens` to `getAppUserSession` and `getAppUserTokens`:

   **ServerComponent Example (before):**
    ```tsx
    import { getSession, getUserTokens } from '@frontegg/nextjs/app';

    export const ServerSession = async () => {
      const userSession = await getSession();
      const tokens = await getUserTokens();
      return (
        <div>
          <div>user session server side: {JSON.stringify(userSession)}</div>;
          <div>user tokens server side: {JSON.stringify(tokens)}</div>
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```
    
    **ServerComponent Example (after):**
    ```tsx
    import { getAppUserSession, getAppUserTokens } from '@frontegg/nextjs/app';

    export const ServerSession = async () => {
      const userSession = await getAppUserSession();
      const tokens = await getAppUserTokens();
      return (
        <div>
          <div>user session server side: {JSON.stringify(userSession)}</div>;
          <div>user tokens server side: {JSON.stringify(tokens)}</div>
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```
